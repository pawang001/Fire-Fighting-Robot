## 📜 Project Description

The Fire Fighting Robot is designed to:
- Detect fire using IR/Flame sensors.
- Navigate by avoiding obstacles with proximity sensors.
- Automatically stop near the fire source.
- Activate the water pump and spray water using a servo motor to extinguish the fire.
- Resume navigation once the fire is extinguished.

It uses:
- **Arduino UNO** as the microcontroller
- **Servo motor** for rotating the sprayer
- **DC motors** for movement
- **Water pump** for fire extinguishing
- **IR sensors** for obstacle detection

The robot was programmed using Arduino C++, and the hardware setup includes a basic chassis, motor driver, pump module, and sensors.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The robot moves forward by default.
2. If it detects an obstacle, it decides to turn left or right accordingly.
3. If it detects fire in front, it stops and activates the pump and servo mechanism to extinguish the fire.
4. After the fire is put off, it resets and starts moving again.
